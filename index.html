                  <p>Hello, my fellow Muslims my name is Shahryar Raza it I got by (Jerry) for short or for white people who can’t pronounce my name right. As you guys might have noticed Issra and Sonia sanduradijnnn has invited not only I but the whole msa group chat as well to come to a place known as gyro king ( link http://gyroking.net/) now before we get any false allegations. I am always “down” ( as seher says it )to go. But in the end I do not want to go alone because of the fact that no one is there with me. Now although u guys may be quick to judge take this into consideration this is going to be one of the last nights of ramandan according to bassel(sc: basselthebassil). So I would like to live up to this moment as much as I could. Also just in case y’all would like to contact me over there at gyro king are are seeing this message right now this is my personal website for u to contact me(ShahryarRaza12.github.io)( this is a beta website that i have made just for this). So furthermore I would also like to thank yaqoob Zaidi( because I fucking love yaqoob) and seher ( because whenever she smiles she reminds me of jigsaw from saw 😜😜) #donthatemeplease. I would also like to thank areebahhhh(gf) for inspiration and helping me get through with ideas to spare. I would also like to thank Issra for allowing me to do this( Issra.com) also I would like to thank Sonia which makes no sense how she is even here because all Jinns are supposed to be locked up but Allah has his ways. In the end sid I would just consider the fact that if you are going than I will go aswell.

                  <p>Hello, my fellow Muslims my name is Shahryar Raza it I got by (Jerry) for short or for white people who can’t pronounce my name right. As you guys might have noticed Issra and Sonia sanduradijnnn has invited not only I but the whole msa group chat as well to come to a place known as gyro king ( link http://gyroking.net/) now before we get any false allegations. I am always “down” ( as seher says it )to go. But in the end I do not want to go alone because of the fact that no one is there with me. Now although u guys may be quick to judge take this into consideration this is going to be one of the last nights of ramandan according to bassel(sc: basselthebassil). So I would like to live up to this moment as much as I could. Also just in case y’all would like to contact me over there at gyro king are are seeing this message right now this is my personal website for u to contact me(ShahryarRaza12.github.io)( this is a beta website that i have made just for this). So furthermore I would also like to thank yaqoob Zaidi( because I fucking love yaqoob) and seher ( because whenever she smiles she reminds me of jigsaw from saw 😜😜) #donthatemeplease. I would also like to thank areebahhhh(gf) for inspiration and helping me get through with ideas to spare. I would also like to thank Issra for allowing me to do this( Issra.com) also I would like to thank Sonia which makes no sense how she is even here because all Jinns are supposed to be locked up but Allah has his ways. In the end sid I would just consider the fact that if you are going than I will go aswell.
